s the corrected code with the necessary changes:

```
#include <stddef.h>
#include "main.h"

/**
 * binary_to_uint - converts a binary number to an unsigned int
 * @b: string containing the binary number
 *
 * Return: the converted number, or 0 if there is one or more chars in the
 * string b that is not 0 or 1 or b is NULL.
 */
unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b)
{
    unsigned int result = 0;
    int i;

    if (b == NULL) {
        return 0;
    }

    for (i = 0; b[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        if (b[i] != '0' && b[i] != '1') {
            return 0;
        }

        result = result << 1;
        if (b[i] == '1') {
            result = result | 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

In the corrected code, `stddef.h` has been included to define the `NULL` macro. Additionally, the loop variable `i` has been declared before the for loop, which is allowed in C89/90 mode.

With these changes, the code should compile without errors.
